see you when down here is dull","\nAt night I tell you of all the old, all the new","\nClose in your absence,","\nyou words engraved in my heart","\nYour message is not just words","\n your message is to be human","\nAnd, the more I grew the more the world grew onto me","\nI felt feeling that have come newly to be","\nI told her about the prettiest girl that I see","\nDescribed her to my mother; I’ve never seen anyone like her","\nI don’t know what to say but I think I love her","\nShe said “Tell me more and whats her name?”","\nI don't know and don’t laugh","\nHaste since I was a kid and not patient enough","\nShe said “The most important thing is to value correctly when in love.”","\nKnow her value and never dare break her dreams","\nAnd don’t be haste say the word when you feel it not when it seems","\nNever hide off from her always speak clear as gleams","\nMany years have passed and you’ve seen your grandchildren grow","\nDespite our separation you still in every birthday you show","\nYou come to me in every happiness and also in sorrow","\nI can’t imagine that I have never seen you","\nGod has chosen you to be by his side when I was just a newborn","\nCertainly you’re in a better place and I am happy for you","\nAnd so, you wrote me one thousand letters and stories","\nTrying to compensate on what I have missed and yet to miss","\nBut, I miss you. I wish you were here","\nI have always felt your presence, would’ve loved to make you feel my love","\nI am sure you can hear and see me","\nIf I can’t see you through my eyes, my heart can see you from down here","\nUp in the sky I see you when down here is dull","\nAt night I tell you of all the old, all the new","\nClose in your absence","\nyou words engraved in my heart","\nYour message is not just words","\nyour message is to be human"]}]}]

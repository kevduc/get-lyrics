# Gathering data for an Egyptian Arabic <-> English translation model ðŸ’¬

The data is gathered from translations of Egyptian songs on lyrics websites.
This is achieved using the JavaScript scripts in the `scripts` folder, executed with Node.

## ðŸ“¥ Gathering data from lyricstranslate.com

1. ðŸ“œ `getArtistsLinks.js` gets and saves a list of only Egyptian Artists

2. ðŸ“œ `downloadData.js` gets and saves the list of their songs and the lyrics both in Arabic and English for each song (bonus: it also gets the transliteration)

3. ðŸ“œ `preprocessData.js` splits the verse ID from its text into 2 arrays. It does this for every songs of every artists, so it's easier to compile the data afterwards.

4. ðŸ“œ `compileData.js` compiles the data into 2 arrays of sentences, one containing all the Arabic verses and one containing all the English verses. It's aligning the data, e.g. it's matching the verse ID from each language so that the sentence at index i of the English array corresponds to the translation of the sentence at index i in the Arabic array.

## âš™ Using the data
The model will be trained using MATLAB, the data can then be imported as a table.  
In the `matlab` folder:
- ðŸ”  `tableTotal.mat` contains all the Egyptian Arabic - English sentence pairs, it's the table that will be used for training
- ðŸ“œ `makeTable.m` generates this table. This script imports the JSON data as a table in MATLAB.

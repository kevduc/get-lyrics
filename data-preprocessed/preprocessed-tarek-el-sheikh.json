remorse remorse","\nYou will live your life feeling remorse","\nRemorse remorse remorse","\nAfter you leave me you will see woe and pain","\nA remorse as great as the love you wished for","\nA remorse as great as my suffering however it would be too late to know my value","\nThe coming days will be the proof","\nTomorrow you will come back with shame(broken eye)","\nWhen you suffer of loneliness and experience the  regret of your lifetime","\nRegret me and feel a little of my heart ache","\nDo not think that you fooled me with your lies","\nYou wanted me to burn in fire and never show pain","\nShowing up a little and disappear again and you want me to accept that and not to complain","\nI always came back and said OK even though I was suffering","\nI will never accept  this any more and be silent","\nI should have rejected it even if it killed me","\nWho wants to be just a shadow with no use","\nRegret who you are and learn to live free and be honest","\nWhy do you accept that and  cheapen yourself","\nLive clean(honest) for the rest of your life","\nI know your whole story and it is quite clear","\nI should have known what you are and wake up","\nYou are just someone who wants an easy life","\nSomeone who has no feelings of humanity","\nAll you know is for how much you can take me","\nYou compromise even though you believe it is a game","\nEvery thing you want you get nothing is difficult","\nI stood by you and you left my hugs and embrace","\nLife entertains you but your end is soon","\nI was kind but not any more","\nYou are breaking down night after night and insulting your heart","\nEach time your tears are fallen next to you","\nWhat forces me to love some one with no dignity","\nDo you think your gains  out of this path","\nwould add any  respect and  value to who you are","\nYou are someone I do not want to know and goodbye","ندم ندم ندم","\nهتعيش طول عمرك تحس بندم","\nندم ندم ندم","\nهتشوف من بعدى الويل والام","\nهتندم قد ما اتمنيت تصون الحب

ندم عمرك","\nاندم عليا ودوق عذاب قلبى شويه","\nاوعاك تفكر كدبتك دخلت عليا","\nعايزانى فى النار انطفى ولا يوم ابين","\nتظهر شويه وتختفى واسكت واسهين","\nوارجع واقول معلشى وانا اعيش فى ازمه","\nعمرى ما هقبل بلكلام ده وبسكوتى","\nكان لازم ارفض حتى لو كان فيها موتى","\nمين ده يقبل يبقى ضل ملوهش لزمه","\nندمان انك واياك تتعلم تعيش حر وتبقى شريف","\nبتهون على نفسك ليه ترخص نفسك","\nمتعيش باقى العمر نضيف","\nعارف حكايتك كلها والقصه واضحه","\nكان لازم اعرف انت ايه كان لازم اصحى","\nانت يا دوب حد وعايز سكه سهله","\nانسان ملهوش فى الانسانه مشاعرو جارة","\nكل الى عايزو وتعرفو بكام تاخدنى","\nعمال تراضى وانت راضى تبقى لعبه","\nكل الى عايزو بتلاقيه ولا حاجه صعبه","\nوقفت جنبك قد ايه وفارقت حضنى","ندمان انك واياك تتعلم تعيش حر وتبقى شريف","\nبتهون على نفسك ليه ترخص نفسك","\nمتعيش باقى العمر
